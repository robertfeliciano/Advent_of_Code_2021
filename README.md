# Advent of Code 2021

I will put my solutions to the 2021 Advent of Code in this repository. I may nto do all the puzzles the day they are posted because of school work, but I set a goal of doing all of them eventually.

I also plan on using different programming languages for the puzzles. I plan on having a mix of languages like C/C++, Java, Python, Rust, and more!
